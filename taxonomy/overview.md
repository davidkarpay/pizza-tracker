# Taxonomy overview (how to classify a pizza)

Use TWO layers:
1) Primary style (named bucket)
2) Attributes (what actually defines the eating experience)

When you are uncertain on style, choose the closest primary style and lean on attributes to be precise.

Examples:
- A foldable slice that is crisp-with-chew: primary = New York style; attributes = [thin, crisp_with_chew, foldable, by_the_slice]
- A rectangular pan with caramelized edge: primary = Detroit style; attributes = [thick, airy, pan_fried, caramel_edge]
- Very thin, cracker-crisp, square cut: primary = Chicago tavern style; attributes = [thin, cracker_crisp, party_square_cut]

If you want to expand the taxonomy later:
- Add new named styles only when they are meaningfully distinct
- Prefer adding attributes over multiplying named buckets
