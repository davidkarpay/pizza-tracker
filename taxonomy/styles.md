# Pizza style taxonomy (starter)

This is a *starter* taxonomy meant to be practical for ordering and for map filtering.
It separates “named styles” from “attributes” that often matter more than the name.

## Named styles (primary)

1. New York style
   - Thin to medium-thin, crisp-with-chew, foldable slices, moderate sauce and mozzarella.

2. Neapolitan
   - Very hot bake, soft/wet center, puffy rim, char spots, simple toppings.

3. New Haven (apizza)
   - Thin, drier, charred/coal-oven leaning, structured crisp, often less cheese.

4. Chicago tavern style
   - Very thin, cracker-crisp, square cut, often party-friendly.

5. Detroit style
   - Rectangular pan pizza, airy crumb, crisp bottom, caramelized cheese edge.

6. Sicilian
   - Thicker rectangular, airy crumb; less “caramel edge” than Detroit, often more bread-like.

7. Roman al taglio
   - Rectangular by-the-cut, very crisp bottom, airy interior, often reheated.

8. Deep dish
   - Tall, layered, knife-and-fork, heavy structure, sauce-forward.

9. Bar pie
   - Small/medium thin pies, very crisp, often tavern context, balanced toppings.

10. St. Louis style
   - Very thin, very crisp, square cut, distinct processed cheese approach in many examples.

11. California artisan (catch-all)
   - Not a single style; use when the place is “chef-driven” with nontraditional toppings and mixed techniques.
   - If you use this, rely heavily on attributes.

## How to use it
- Choose ONE primary style (even if imperfect).
- Add attributes to express what you actually liked (crisp, char, sauce amount, etc.).
